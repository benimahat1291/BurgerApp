## Functionality

User enter the name of the burger into the search bar. That burger will be populated in an area below depending of the user selected to eat the burger right away or have it ready to server. From there the user can delete the burger or toggle between eating it or staging it be be ready to serve again.

## Challenges
The Hardest thing about this project was the Heroku deployment. It was difficult to set up the sequealize connection for the first time.
